### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: scripts](/analysis/scripts): R code files that analyse 
    and visualise the data to produce the figures and tables
  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
    Our readme file describes where we got each file from
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:    
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:    
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio on your computer    
- run `renv::restore()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (this will install any you don't have)    
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console, or run the code in the script files.
